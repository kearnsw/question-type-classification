# Resource and Response Type Classification for Consumer Health Question Answering

This repository will hold all the code and data necessary to replicate the results of the paper:

```Kearns, W., Thomas, J. Resource and Response Type Classification for Consumer Health Question Answering. AMIA Annual Symposium 2018.```

Currently, we are unable to release the data for the Yahoo! Answers data. However, we are working on generating a crosswalk so that other researchers can apply our annotations to the [L6 - Yahoo! Answers Comprehensive Questions and Answers](webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com) corpus. We intend for this to be finished by 11/15/18 and will provide complete instructions on how to replicate our results at that time.
